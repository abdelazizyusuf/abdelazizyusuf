👋 Hi, I’m @baileydauterman

👀 I’m an industrial engineer with a passion for technology and automation. My interests span across various areas including industrial control systems, artificial intelligence applications in manufacturing, and process optimization.

🌱 I’m currently on a perpetual journey of learning, always seeking to expand my knowledge and skills in industrial engineering and related technologies. Project-wise, I'm actively involved in the development of AdminTools, a suite of tools aimed at enhancing administrative processes, and I'm also tackling the CryptoPals challenges to sharpen my problem-solving skills.

💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on any exciting projects in the field of industrial engineering, automation, or AI. I particularly enjoy technical content writing and sharing insights with the community through blog posts, tutorials, and documentation.
